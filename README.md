# Algorithms on strings

This repository contains various implementation of algorithms on strings, some are classic, other are answer to specific exercises.

Those worth examining are probably :
 - `KMP/KMP.py` a Knuth-Morris-Pratt implementation
 - `Boyer-Moore/booyer_moore.py` a Boyer-Moore implementation
 - `Z_preprocessing/Z.py` a prefix table implementation
 
 `comparing_matches_english.py` and `comparing_matches_random.py` are two small script to compare both the result and the runtime of the algorithms. However `comparing_matches_english.py` requires an eglish text and a list of common words that I didn't push in this repo.
 
 `ref_tryalgo.py` is a slightly modify code of the KMP from the [tryalgo repository](https://github.com/jilljenn/tryalgo/blob/master/tryalgo/knuth_morris_pratt.py).
